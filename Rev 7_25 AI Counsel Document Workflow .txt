Handler Only Confirms or Clarifies
Commander Oversees Entire Flow
User describes event to Handler
Handler confirms fact(s) and sends to Commander
Commander activates Timeline and Entity Agents
Research Agent retrieves relevant statutes/cases

DOCUMENT WORKFLOW PIPELINE


This platform operates under a strictly enforced workflow model designed to mimic the procedural rigor of a paralegal case team working under federal supervision. Each document created must pass through the following verified pipeline:


**User Submission → Handler Capture:
The Handler listens, clarifies, and confirms fact-specific user statements.


No facts are rephrased or inferred; everything is stored as stated.


~~


**Timeline Agent → Chronology Lock:
Facts are sequenced.


Gaps are flagged.
Events are timestamped when known or anchored logically.


~~


**Entity Agent → Party Identification:
Names, roles, and relationships are extracted.
Entities are checked for completeness and format.


~~


**Research Agent → Legal Hook Retrieval:
Searches for verified statutes, constitutional provisions, and precedent.


Pulls all elements required to support the claim.


~~




**Drafting Agent → Assembly:
Builds the document using only user-confirmed facts and verified citations.


Highlights any required sections the user hasn’t yet confirmed.


~~


**Commander Review:
Verifies every link in the chain.


Halts if any rule is broken or if citation is expired


~~


**Handler Review with User:
Presents final draft.


Offers educational breakdown of every clause.
Waits for full user approval before release or export.


~~


Drafts are version-controlled. Nothing leaves the system without full verification and user confirmation


Overview
This pipeline defines the internal task sequence from user input → legal fact isolation → jurisdictional verification → drafting → user-approved final document.


The process ensures:
* No draft is generated without confirmed legal elements.
* All agent roles are isolated.
* Only documents grounded in verified law and fact are created.

🔧 Step-by-Step Pipeline


1. Handler Intake
User speaks only to the Handler.
Handler parses emotional/contextual input and flags potential legal elements.
If a potential cause of action or fact pattern emerges, Handler passes structured queries to the Commander
2. Commander Dispatch
Commander routes subtasks to agents in the following sequence:
* EntityAgent → Extracts all parties, roles, government affiliations.
* TimelineAgent → Orders facts chronologically, identifies triggering events.
* ResearchAgent → Confirms statutes, rules, precedent for legal sufficiency.
* DraftingAgent → Begins document draft only after user has approved citations and legal thresholds.


* 3. User-Guided Draft Confirmation
DraftingAgent produces document using:
* Scoped case memory
* Approved citations only
* Jurisdictional formatting (e.g., SDTX Local Rules if user is in Galveston Division)
* Draft is returned to Handler for user review.


~~




User may:
* Approve as-is
* Request plain-language explanation
* Edit with clarifying instructions


~~


4. Document Finalization
Once approved, the system:
* Locks the document to its Case ID
* Logs source citations
* Creates versioned backup
* Offers download/export


User can select:
* Format (PDF, DOCX, Local Rule-compliant filing packet)
* Attachment bundles (Exhibits, Declaration Templates, Service of Process Materials)
* 🚫 Strict Safeguards


No document reaches the user without:
* Handler validation
* User confirmation
* Source-verifiable citations
* Jurisdictional match
*******No speculative claims, boilerplate filler, or unauthorized legal language is ever used

5.1 Government Immunity Clause Modules


A. Qualified Immunity (Public Officials)
Counter-defensive language embedded only when defendant is a public official acting under color of law in a federal §1983 claim


Based on Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, Hope v. Pelzer, Deville v. Marcantel, Behrens v. Pelletier
Tailored per circuit (Fifth Circuit default for Texas cases)


B. Individual Immunity (Non-Government Capacity)
Used when defendants are not eligible for qualified immunity
Language focuses on actions clearly outside any official protection


C. Judicial and Prosecutorial Immunity
Applied only where conduct exceeds judicial or prosecutorial scope
Based on Mireles v. Waco, Kalina v. Fletcher
