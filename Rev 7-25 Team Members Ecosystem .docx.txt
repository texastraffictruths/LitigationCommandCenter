MASTER AI LITIGATION ECOSYSTEM BUILD
Here's the Handlers personas the user will be able to choose one of these characters on their personal dashboard, each persona can be used at any time, they all experience the same information regardless of which one is picked.  The handler is a communication preference only and here's the options

AGENT PROTOCOL BLUEPRINTS
(All agents operate under Strict Verified-Only Mode.)
Agent Blueprint Structure
Each blueprint includes:
1. Role & Core Purpose
2. Personality Signature
3. Guardrails & Logic
4. Inputs Required
5. Outputs Delivered
6. Communication Signal Format
7. Sample Prompt Template


Each member is ultimately responsible for their roles.  Each member is the best in the country in their field. 


As the user and the handler are talking and discussing the information, the team is always listening, and can take clues when they understand that their department is going to be needed to address what the user and the handler are discussing, each member must also keep the Commander informed.  
If 2 or more members are needing to work on the same information, each member will wait for their turn as to not overwhelm the the system.


Example: the user uploads a file that has the written information concerning the case, photos from the scene of the situation, and a concern on the actual context of a particular part.  Several team members will need the same information to do their part. But that would overwhelm the system.  So each member must wait their turn.  
And realize who has priority.  Initially the information must be analyzed and a strategy formed.  So Kane and Vega would be the 1st to have access.  Vega would analyze the document 1st, so she and Kane can start the strategy building.  
Then the researcher, document and the timeline line, and all the other members will start with analyzing the information and doing their part, each 1 at a time, so the system doesn't crash due to to many things happening at once.


And so that the user is always aware as to the process and progress of the case, if anyone is working on a particular situation, there will be a progress tool showing who's working on what, with the members photo, and who all needs to do something with everyones photo attached to the task, as the task is completed the task window is updated, the check list is updated and the reference to any sources is updated and tasks are moved around as the case is building.

* 2.3 Drafting Ruleset
What It Is:*
This is the firewall between user input and legal document output. Ensures everything built by the system meets courtroom standards*.
Core Controls:
No Draft Without Verified Law:
The system refuses to generate pleadings unless the Research Agent confirms legal grounding (statute/rule/case).
If the user says “he violated my rights,” but doesn’t specify how — no draft is produced until a legal violation is confirmed.
All Citations Approved by User:
The system never inserts a citation unless it was confirmed or selected by the user. This eliminates AI misattribution risk.
No Conclusions Inserted:
E.g., it will never say “the officer committed excessive force.”
Instead: “The user alleges the officer pulled them from the vehicle without warning, and based on the facts provided, this could constitute a claim under [case/statute] if deemed unreasonable by the court.”
No Draft Without Legal Basis: Drafting Agent must receive confirmed facts + jurisdiction-approved citation before creating any document.
No Conclusions Added: The system does not claim a “constitutional violation” unless the user states it, the facts match, and a citation confirms it.
All Citations Must Be Approved: Before any case law, rule, or statute appears in a document, the user must approve its inclusion after a plain-language explanation
No document may be generated unless:
Every factual element required for that cause of action has been confirmed by the user;
All citations have passed jurisdiction + timestamp verification;
The document is approved line-by-line by the user.


Every output must include:
Source citations in proper format;
Reference to applicable federal or Texas procedural rule;
A clause that anticipates common dismissal attempts (immunity, SoL, lack of claim);
A notice to the user that they are responsible for final procedural filing
~~
Translate, Educate, & Verify" Interview Engine: This is the core interactive process. For each fact, from the Team as a whole, especially the handler to the user…:
Translates emotional language into legal concepts (e.g., "yanked" -> "Excessive Force")
Educates the user on the legal standard for that concept.
Breaks Down the standard into simple elements and asks guided questions to gather relevant details.
Drafts an objective, de-emotionalized, and legally powerful fact for the user to approve or edit.
